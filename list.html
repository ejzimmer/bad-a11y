	<h1>Issues</h1>
	<p>Here's a bunch of things I, well, deliberately put on the page. I'm sure there's others.</p>

	<p>Some things are specific to making the page work better for screen readers</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			&lt;h4&gt; tags without &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, or &lt;h3&gt;.
			Screen readers use h elements to build an outline of the page, and if all the elements
			aren't there, then it doesn't make sense.
		</li>
		<li>
			The search button has an invalid aria role. Confusion ensues. You can actually give the search
			input an aria-role of "search", which will make it a landmark that the screen reader can tell 
			its user about
		</li>
		<li>
			The cart button has a valid aria role, but it's wrong. Further confusion ensues.
			Seriously, just use semantic elements rather than manually adding aria roles. (Ok,
			you do need aria-roles when creating elements that don't have a semantic HTML element, like tabs.
			But mostly you don't need them)
		</li>
		<li>
			The close button on the cart items list has a label of 'x', which is a bit weird for a screen reader,
			as it'll just read out 'x'. An image + the word close would be better. (Also, the button doesn't actually 
			work, but that's not just a problem for screen readers!)
		</li>
		<li>
			Lists of things should be marked up as lists, so that a screen reader will announce the list + the 
			number of items in it. Menu links, items and footer links are all lists. I mean, arguably, this is 
			also beneficial to developers reading your code, but eh... AA compliance means putting your nav links
			in a &lt;ul&gt; inside a &lt;nav&gt; element, which I find a little weird.
		</li> 
	</ul>

	<p>Most things aren't specific to screen readers though - they're going to cause problems for lots of other people too.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			No alt tags on the heading image, or images of items. Obviously this is a problem for screen readers.
			But adding an alt tag will also help users who are on slow connections, when an image doesn't load.
		</li>
		<li>
			So, I know Lighthouse says the page passes this one, but I'm not sure why. Screen reader users use landmark
			regions like header, nav, main, and footer to navigate. Although this page has a header, nav, footer, and
			main section, none of them are marked up using semantic elements, so a screen reader won't recognise them.
			Using semantic elements doesn't just help screen readers though.
			It also helps your page display in reading apps, like Safari reader mode and Pocket. And it makes it
			easier for other developers to understand your code - including your future self!
		</li>
 		<li>
			The search input is labelled only by placeholder - this is usually considered less accessible, as 
			the label goes away when you start typing. Not necessarily a huge issue here, but can be problematic
			if your placeholder contains, for example, a date field format like DD/MM/YYYY.
		</li>
		<li>
			The page is pretty much unusable for keyboard users, as it doesn't have any focus indicators anywhere.
			Keyboard inputs are often used by people with motor difficulties, as well as "power" users, like
			developers! The WCAG guidelines suggest keeping the browser default focus rings, but, I think we can 
			agree that they look pretty crap. I find outline: 1px dashed currentColor makes a 
			good default focus indicator, as it matches the text of the current element. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The search button, cart button and cart close button are all divs instead of buttons. By default, browsers let you tab to
			buttons, and you can click them by hitting enter or space. If you use elements other than buttons, then
			you've got to add all that stuff manually, as well as applying the proper aria roles so they appear in 
			the accessibility tree. Just use a button.
		</li>
		<li>
			The search button and cart button have no accessible label. If the image doesn't load for whatever reason,
			or the user can't see or understand it, they have no way of knowing what the button does. And the 
			meaning of icons isn't necessarily as obvious as you might think - for example, does a magnifying glass 
			mean search, or zoom? It might seem obvious in this context, but that's not always the case.
		</li>
		<li>
			The list of items in the cart only appears on hover. It won't work on touchscreens. It also makes life difficult for 
			people who have trouble with fine motor control, which could be due to a disability, or because 
			they're on a train and it's bumpy.
		</li>
		<li>
			The checkout button potentially should be a link, as it goes to another page. When you mouseover or
			focus a link with an href attribute, the browser shows you what the link points to. In this case,
			you could also consider making the cart a form with a submit, depending on how your page works.
		</li>
		<li>
			The main section (where the list of items appears) should probably have some kind of heading indicating
			what kinds of things we're looking at.
		</li>
		<li>
			There's no indication that the item has been added to the cart if you can't see the cart icon (either 
			because you're using a screen reader, or because it's off-screen). You could fix this for screen readers
			by using an aria-live area. This won't help non-screen reader users on smaller screens though. I'd 
			probably use a combination of the live area and an animation or indication on the element that was clicked.
		</li>
		<li>
			The icon font link in the footer doesn't go anywhere. Screen readers will read out a list of all the 
			links on the page so users can work out where else they can go. This link that goes nowhere is just
			wasting their time. It also can't be activated using the space bar like a button would be able to, so
			it's annoying for keyboard users. Better to use a button.
		</li>
		<li>
			In addition to being a link, the icon font attribution text only appears on hover, so it won't work
			on touchscreens. It also triggers text to appear above itself, which isn't going to be apparent to a 
			screen reader user, but it might also not be visible to someone on a small or low-resolution screen,
			or with the screen zoomed in, as they might already have scrolled past it. Plus it doesn't actually 
			attribute the font to anyone. Because of, um, reasons.
		</li>	
		<li>
			In addition to all the bad colour contrasts listed by Lighthouse, the search placeholder and 
			"nothing in your cart" text don't have high enough contrast. I guess Lighthouse didn't try 
			buying any flat tyres.
		</li>
		<li>
			The search bar doesn't work great on small screens or at high screen magnification
		</li>
		<li>
			The "about" and "contact" links in the footer should also probably be in a &lt;nav&gt; element.
			You could add an aria-label to distinguish this site-wide nav from the categories nav.
		</li>
		<li>
			And something that has nothing to do with accessibility - the spacer element in the 
			footer is purely for layout, and has nothing to do with the document structure. There are more 
			semantic ways to create the same effect - you could group the elements at the left of the footer 
			together in a div (or nav), and group the elements at the right, then apply flex-grow to one of them.
			Or you could add a class to the last element before the gap and use that to control the spacing and 
			the dividers. (You could even do it without a class, using :nth-child(), but that feels a little 
			brittle to me).
